This program generates a random password of length 8 by combining characters from different character sets. 

The character sets are defined as strings:
- upper contains uppercase letters (A-Z)
- lower contains lowercase letters (a-z)
- num contains numbers (1-9)
- specialChars contains special characters

These character sets are then combined into one string called combination.

The program uses a loop to generate each character of the password. It creates an empty char array called password. Inside the loop, it uses the Random class and its nextInt() method to generate a random index within the length of the combined string (combination). It then retrieves the character at that index and assigns it to the corresponding position in the password array.

Finally, it prints out the generated password as a string using System.out.println().import java.util.Random;

public class RandomPasswordGenerator
{
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  // Define character sets for upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters
  String upper ="ABCDEFGHJIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
  String lower ="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
  String num = "123456789";
  String specialChars ="<>,.?/}{}}+-_)(*&^%$#@!=)";
  
  // Combine all character sets into one string for password generation
  String combination = upper + lower + num + specialChars;
  
  // Define the length of the generated password
  int len = 8;
  
   // Create a character array to store the generated password
   char[] password=new char[len];
   
   Random r = new Random();
   
   // Generate random characters from the combined set and store them in the password array 
   for(int i=;i     password[i]= combination.charAt(r.nextInt(combination.length()));
   }
  
   // Print out the generated password as a string
   System.out.println("Generated password is:" + new String(password));
Â }
}
```
