Task 2: Palindrome Checker
objectve: Implement a program that checks
whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome. A
palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the
same forwards and backward, ignoring spaces and
punctuation.
Skills: String manipulation, loops, conditional
statements.

public class abc {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize the original string
        String s = "life has got all twists and turns";
        
        // Initialize the reversed string to be empty
        String rev = "";
        
        // Loop from the end of the string to the beginning
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // Append each character to the reversed string
            rev = rev + s.charAt(i);
        }
        
        // Check if the original string is equal to the reversed string
        if (s.equals(rev)) {
            // If they are equal, print that it's a palindrome
            System.out.println("palindrome String");
        } else {
            // If they are not equal, print that it's not a palindrome
            System.out.println("not a palindrome String");
        }
    }
}
String Reversal: The program constructs a reversed version of the string by appending characters from the end of the original string to a new string (rev).
Palindrome Check: A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards. The program checks this by comparing the original string with its reversed version.
